# Note Keeper App

The Note Keeper web application is a simple tool for users to create and manage notes. Users can add, edit, and delete notes, as well as view a list of all their notes. The application uses React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Material-UI, a UI framework for React that provides pre-built components and styling.

The motivation behind this project was to create a tool that would help users keep track of their notes and ideas in a simple and easy-to-use interface. The project also provided an opportunity to gain experience with React.js and Material-UI, as well as with other technologies such as Git and GitHub for version control.

In addition to basic note management features, the application also uses local storage to save user notes even after the page is refreshed or closed. This allows users to return to their notes at any time and continue working on them.

Overall, the Note Keeper project is a practical example of how React.js and Material-UI can be used to build a simple yet functional web application.
